# In the loop

In the loop is a mobile app designed for people that want to stay connected to the people they care about abroad.

## Persona

1.  _Keyser SÃ¶ze_ is an international businessman with clients and associates all over the world. _Keyser_ needs a quick and efficient way to keep tabs on his associates - like knowing the local time (to decide when to contact them), local weather and news (to strengthen their interpersonal relations by making small talk) and to keep a short note of essential details about the contact (to bring up on their next interaction).

2.  _Dave Kujan_ is a customs agent that has many friends and family living abroad. Dave is looking for a better way to keep the personal relations he has with people that live on a different schedule as a result of different time zones.
    _Dave_ wants a quick way to see where all his friends are all over the world and to be kept up to date with important local events in their countries (so they have common things to talk about!).
